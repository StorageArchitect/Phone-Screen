# Phone Screen Code Snippets

I had worked for the same company for close to two decades and after hitting a professional growth plateau, I started to feel that it was time to move on.
 
Now a days, almost all Tech companies require some sort of online phone screen before they bring the candidate in house for a full screen.

During the phone screen candidates are required to solve a minor code problem to demonstrate that they can actually code in the language of their choice. This can be very intimidating. While I had interviewed a lot of candidates to staff my teams both state side and overseas, I had not interviewed for a software position in quite sometime.

The good news is that there is a entire cottage industry dedicated to preparing candidates for such interviews. While I do not endorse any particular web site, some of the popular sites are

Broadly speaking the online/phone screen problems can be knowledge based (specific to a language of choice) and/or reasoning based (basic logic/ algorithms). The knowledge based problems typically are used to validate your basic understanding of the syntax, or language constructs. These problems are solved based not on intuitive understanding of the programming concepts but by the genuine use of the language of choice.

Reasoning problems are more to validate the candidates understanding of fundamental concepts of computer science, data structures or algorithms.

Typical phone screen can be anywhere from 45 - 60 min, including the brief introductions, candidates should be prepared to get cracking without a whole lot of pleasantries or familiarity with the online screen tool. Over the few months of practice (sometimes it feels like a parlor game) I began to get a feel for ideal candidate problem for the phone screen. Look for sub problems in well known algorithms (sorting/counting/string manipulation) something that can be solved either recursively or iteratively in anywhere between 20 to 30 lines of code.

Another quirk to be aware of; some screeners want the candidate to code up a syntactically correct function/method in the language of their choice. In other words, you just code the method, there is no "driver" method provided so to speak. This was the hardest part for me.

In this situation, it is best to focus on the input values and desired output values *and* debug the function by walking through each line of code for a representative sample input. Selecting the right representative input is critical in these situations.

In other cases there is a "driver" method that is already provided along with some sample input. The "driver" method  calls the said function executing it for various input values either displaying the output or printing out the result.

I felt that the latter approach gave me greater satisfaction because I could actually see the results of the execution of the function and correct any issues.

I started down the path of creating a repository of code snippets to prepare for these types of online screens. This repo contains code snippets from that effort.

I wrote the code and programs in these files on my own time, I claim no ownership of the code or the problems to which these solutions that are in this repo. Please be aware that there may be code snippets in this repo that may look similar in part of whole to other code snippets that can be found by searching the internet. 

While this is not intentional, it speaks to the nature of the job as a developer:

 *learn something interesting* --> *internalize* --> *code it* --> *test and release*
