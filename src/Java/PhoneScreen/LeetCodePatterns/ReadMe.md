## About The Package 

There are a large number of problems on leetcode. Working through all the problems on the website takes a long time.
This project is to work through the common patterns identified as appearing in the problem leetcode set. The goal of 
this effort is to work through the underlying patterns behind each question — so developers don’t have  to worry about
solving hundreds of problems and suffer from Leetcode fatigue. 
 
If developers understand the generic patterns, they can use these patterns as a template to solve a myriad of other
problems with slight variations.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on practicing problems within a common thread to get an understand the structure of the problem
* You shouldn't be doing the same analysos over and over 
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

A list of commonly refered to website that are helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
